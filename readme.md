For my webpage design, I chose to have the carousel be the focal point where it would
revolve between items that would showcase why to choose my task manager and to 
sign up. Underneath the carousel, there are 2 cards, which represents the two
paths for people visting: either sign up or log in. Clicking sign up will
bring user to a new user form to create an account. If they click log in,
they will be brought to their dashboard. For hierarchy, I put tasks to complete
at the top and then completed tasks underneath. On the side at the same level as
tasks to complete, I added a button for a user to create a new task. I utilized
modals because I thought some actions were redundant to bring to an entirely
new page.
